Minimal Vite + React (TypeScript) project — cleaned starter template.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build

```powershell
npm run build
```

Notes

- The default Vite starter logos and example counter have been removed from `src/App.tsx`.
- Keep `src/index.css` for global styles; update as needed.
- If you want the original template files back, check your Git history or ask me to restore them.

Next steps

- Implement app pages and routing.
- Add project-specific README content and contributor notes.
